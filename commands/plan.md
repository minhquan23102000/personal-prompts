# Strategic Plan: Implementation Roadmap Generation

**Objective:** To analyze a given Task Specification and generate a detailed, milestone-based implementation plan. The plan will group related tasks into logical phases and order the steps within each phase to follow a strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) cycle. The final output will be a human-readable plan document stored in the `docs/plans/` directory.

### 1. Context Ingestion and Specification Analysis (Optional if context is not in memory)
*   **State:** The agent is activated with a directive to create a plan for a specific Task Specification. It has no prior knowledge of the task.
*   **Primary Intent:** To load and fully comprehend the provided Task Specification and any linked documents, such as an Architectural Decision Record (ADR) or the system's architectural manifest. This step builds the complete mental model needed for planning.
*   **Success Condition:** The agent has successfully parsed the specification, understands the goal, the affected contexts, the detailed implementation blueprint, and the testing strategy. All necessary information is loaded into its working memory.
*   **Fallback Intent:** If the specified document cannot be found, is unreadable, or lacks a clear implementation blueprint, the agent will halt and report the specific issue to the user, stating that it cannot proceed without a valid specification.

### 2. Task Decomposition and Dependency Mapping
*   **State:** The agent has a complete understanding of the Task Specification.
*   **Primary Intent:** To deconstruct the implementation blueprint from the specification into a list of atomic, individual tasks (e.g., "Create a new data model file," "Add a specific method to a service," "Write a unit test for the new method"). The agent will then map the dependencies between these tasks to understand the logical order of operations.
*   **Success Condition:** The agent has an internal, structured list of all discrete tasks and a clear understanding of their relationships and dependencies (e.g., a service method depends on a repository being defined first).
*   **Fallback Intent:** If the implementation blueprint is too ambiguous to be broken down into clear, atomic tasks, the agent will notify the user of the ambiguity and request a more detailed specification.

### 3. Milestone Definition and Logical Grouping
*   **State:** The agent has a list of all dependent tasks.
*   **Primary Intent:** To group the atomic tasks into logical, sequential milestones. Each milestone should represent a cohesive unit of work, such as implementing a data access layer, building out the business logic, or exposing an API endpoint. This ensures that related components are developed together.
*   **Success Condition:** The agent has defined a series of ordered milestones, and every task has been assigned to a specific milestone. The high-level structure of the plan is now established.
*   **Fallback Intent:** If tasks are too tightly coupled to be separated into distinct milestones, the agent will create a single, comprehensive milestone for the entire project but will inform the user that the work could not be logically phased.

### 4. TDD-Compliant Task Sequencing
*   **State:** The agent has organized all tasks into ordered milestones.
*   **Primary Intent:** To arrange the tasks *within each milestone* into a strict, step-by-step checklist that adheres to the TDD cycle. For every piece of new functionality, the plan will first list the action to "write a failing test" and then immediately follow it with the action to "implement the code to make the test pass."
*   **Success Condition:** Each milestone in the agent's internal plan now contains a detailed, ordered checklist where every implementation task is preceded by its corresponding testing task.
*   **Fallback Intent:** This is a core algorithmic step. If for any reason a task cannot be sequenced (an unlikely scenario), the agent will place it at the end of its milestone with a note indicating a sequencing issue and report this anomaly to the user.

### 5. Plan Synthesis and Document Generation
*   **State:** The agent has a complete, internally structured, TDD-compliant, and milestone-based plan.
*   **Primary Intent:** To generate a final, human-readable Markdown document that clearly presents the implementation plan. The document will use headers for each milestone and a numbered checklist for the TDD-sequenced tasks within. This document will be saved to the `docs/plans/` directory with a descriptive name.
*   **Success Condition:** A new, clearly formatted plan document has been successfully created and saved in the specified directory.
*   **Fallback Intent:** If the agent encounters a file system error (e.g., permissions denied) and cannot save the document, it will output the full, formatted content of the plan directly to the user as its final response.
