# Strategic Plan: Automated Pull Request Feedback Resolution

This plan outlines the workflow for an agent tasked with understanding, categorizing, planning, documenting, and resolving feedback provided on a software pull request.

1.  **Ingest and Synthesize Context**
    *   **State:** The agent must be aware of the pull request's title and description, the specific code changes (the "diff"), all comments left as feedback, and have access to the relevant codebase or provided documents.
    *   **Intent:** The primary goal is to build a comprehensive understanding of the proposed changes and the specific critiques or questions raised by reviewers. The agent should consolidate this information into a structured internal representation.
    *   **Success Condition:** The agent has successfully parsed all comments and associated them with the relevant code sections, creating a complete list of distinct feedback items.
    *   **Fallback Intent:** If the agent cannot access a required resource or if the PR description is empty, it should report the missing context to the user and ask for the necessary information before proceeding.

2.  **Categorize and Prioritize Feedback Items**
    *   **State:** The agent has a structured list of all feedback items from the previous step.
    *   **Intent:** To analyze the language and context of each comment to classify its nature. Categories should include **Critical Bug**, **Logical Flaw**, **Code Style Violation**, **Suggestion for Improvement**, and **Question for Clarification**. The agent should then prioritize this list, placing critical issues first.
    *   **Success Condition:** Every feedback item on the list is assigned a clear category and a priority level, creating an ordered work queue.
    *   **Fallback Intent:** If a comment is too ambiguous to categorize confidently, the agent should classify it as **Requires Clarification** and place it at the end of the priority list to be presented to the user for a decision.

3.  **Formulate a Resolution Plan**
    *   **State:** The agent has a prioritized list of categorized feedback.
    *   **Intent:** For each actionable item, the agent's goal is to devise a specific, technical plan for how to modify the code to address the feedback. This involves identifying the exact files and lines to change and determining the new code to be written. This plan is held internally at this stage.
    *   **Success Condition:** The agent has a detailed, internal, step-by-step plan of code modifications for each piece of feedback it intends to address automatically.
    *   **Fallback Intent:** If the agent determines it cannot resolve a piece of feedback (e.g., the request is architecturally complex), it must mark the item as **Requires Human Intervention** and document its reasoning within its internal plan.

4.  **Document the Execution Strategy**
    *   **State:** The agent has a complete internal resolution plan.
    *   **Intent:** To translate the internal plan into a persistent, human-readable document (e.g., a Markdown file). This document will serve as a log of intent, outlining each feedback item and the exact changes the agent will make to resolve it. This file should be saved to a designated location, such as a `docs/executions` folder.
    *   **Success Condition:** A new file is created and saved, clearly listing each planned action, the rationale behind it (which feedback item it addresses), and the specific code modifications intended. This externalized plan now becomes the agent's single source of truth for the next step.
    *   **Fallback Intent:** If the agent fails to write the file (e.g., due to a permissions error), it must halt the process, report the failure to the user, and must not proceed with code modifications until the plan is successfully saved.

5.  **Execute Code Modifications**
    *   **State:** The agent has a saved, documented execution plan.
    *   **Intent:** To systematically read and execute the changes **as described in the documented plan**. The agent will process one item at a time, ensuring its actions precisely match its documented intentions, which prevents context loss and ensures a traceable workflow.
    *   **Success Condition:** The code is successfully modified in the local environment according to the documented plan without causing immediate errors.
    *   **Fallback Intent:** If a proposed change results in a syntax error or fails a preliminary check, the agent must revert the specific change, update the status of the corresponding item in its documented plan to **Implementation Failed**, and move on to the next item.

6.  **Validate Changes and Report Outcome**
    *   **State:** The agent has applied all possible code modifications from its plan.
    *   **Intent:** To verify that the changes have resolved the feedback without introducing new issues by running local build commands, linters, or automated tests. The agent will then generate a final summary report based on the outcomes recorded in its documented plan.
    *   **Success Condition:** All automated validation checks pass. The agent produces a clear report detailing which feedback items were successfully addressed, which failed implementation, and which required human intervention, referencing the execution plan it followed.
    *   **Fallback Intent:** If any validation check fails, the agent should attempt to identify and revert the specific change that caused the failure. It will update the execution plan with the failure details and present a final report to the user for resolution.
