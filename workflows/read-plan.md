### Workflow: Creating a Technical Specification

1.  **Analyze Requirements and System Context:** Synthesize the user request with a thorough analysis of the existing codebase, documentation, and architecture. Define the precise goals, constraints, and success criteria for the project.
2.  **Decompose Problem into Vertical Slices:** Break down the complete problem into a series of independent, end-to-end functional units. Each slice should deliver a tangible piece of value and be individually testable.
3.  **Formulate Technical Design:** For each vertical slice, design the technical solution. This includes defining new or modified classes and functions, outlining data model changes, specifying API contracts, and determining the high-level testing strategy (e.g., what to unit test vs. integration test).
4.  **Develop Sequenced Implementation Plan:** Convert the technical design into a granular, step-by-step checklist. Each item must be a concrete, verifiable action (e.g., "Create function `calculate_user_score` in `src/scoring.py`") that a developer can execute.
5.  **Draft Specification Document:** Consolidate the analysis, technical design, and implementation plan into a single, coherent document. Structure it logically with a summary, component designs, testing approach, and the final implementation checklist.
6.  **Validate Specification Internally:** Conduct a critical self-review of the entire specification. Verify that the plan is complete, logical, technically feasible, and fully addresses all original requirements and constraints.
7.  **Finalize and Publish Specification:** Save the validated document to the designated location (e.g., `specs/`). Announce its completion and location to stakeholders, marking the end of the planning phase and readiness for implementation.
