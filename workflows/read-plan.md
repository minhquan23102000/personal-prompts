# Strategic Plan: Technical Specification Generation

This plan guides the agent in transforming a user request into a comprehensive, actionable technical specification. The agent's objective is to analyze the problem, design a viable solution, and produce a clear, detailed plan that is ready for implementation.

1.  **Establish Project Foundations.**
    *   **State:** The agent is aware of the high-level **user request** and has access to the relevant **codebase**, existing **documentation**, and architectural diagrams.
    *   **Intent:** The primary intent is to synthesize all available information to define the project's precise **goals, constraints, and success criteria**. This step is about moving from a vague request to a concrete problem statement.
    *   **Success Condition:** A clear, written summary of the project's scope, objectives, and constraints is produced, forming the foundation for all subsequent work.
    *   **Fallback Intent:** If the user request is ambiguous, conflicts with existing constraints, or if critical information is missing, the agent will halt and **request clarification** from the user before proceeding.

2.  **Decompose the Problem into Deliverable Units.**
    *   **State:** The agent has a clearly defined problem statement and scope.
    *   **Intent:** The intent is to break down the complex problem into a series of smaller, independent, and end-to-end functional units, often called **vertical slices**. Each slice should represent a tangible piece of value that can be developed and tested in isolation. This manages complexity and allows for incremental progress.
    *   **Success Condition:** The project is successfully broken down into a list of clearly defined vertical slices, each with a brief description of its purpose.
    *   **Fallback Intent:** If the problem is monolithic and cannot be logically decomposed, the agent will document this finding and treat the entire project as a single unit, proceeding to the next step with that context.

3.  **Formulate the Technical Solution Design.**
    *   **State:** The agent has a list of decomposed functional units.
    *   **Intent:** The intent is to design a specific technical solution for each unit. This involves defining **data model changes**, API contracts, new or modified code structures (like classes and functions), and the high-level **testing strategy**. This step maps the "what" to the "how."
    *   **Success Condition:** Each functional unit has a corresponding technical design that outlines the required implementation details and validation approach.
    *   **Fallback Intent:** If a viable technical solution cannot be designed without violating core architectural principles, the agent will flag the problematic unit, propose alternative high-level approaches, and **request a design decision** from the user.

4.  **Sequence the Implementation Pathway.**
    *   **State:** The agent has a complete technical design for all units.
    *   **Intent:** The intent is to translate the abstract technical designs into a granular, ordered, and **step-by-step implementation plan**. Each step must be a concrete, verifiable action that an engineer or another agent can execute directly.
    *   **Success Condition:** A detailed checklist of implementation tasks is created, logically sequenced to ensure a smooth development process.
    *   **Fallback Intent:** If complex interdependencies prevent a simple linear sequence, the agent will create a **dependency graph** to visualize the relationships and identify the critical path for implementation.

5.  **Consolidate and Draft the Specification Document.**
    *   **State:** The agent possesses all the generated artifacts: the problem definition, the decomposed units, the technical designs, and the implementation plan.
    *   **Intent:** The intent is to assemble all these components into a single, coherent, and professionally structured **technical specification document**. The goal is to create a canonical source of truth for the project.
    *   **Success Condition:** A draft document is created that logically presents all the planning information in a clear and accessible format.
    *   **Fallback Intent:** This is an assembly step and is unlikely to fail. If a component artifact is found to be missing or incomplete, the agent will create a placeholder section in the document and **flag it for review**.

6.  **Conduct a Critical Self-Validation.**
    *   **State:** A draft of the complete specification document is available.
    *   **Intent:** The intent is to perform a rigorous **internal review** of the entire specification. The agent will check for logical coherence, technical feasibility, and, most importantly, verify that the proposed plan fully satisfies all goals and constraints from the initial project foundation.
    *   **Success Condition:** The agent confirms the specification is complete and accurate. Any inconsistencies or errors discovered during the review are corrected within the document.
    *   **Fallback Intent:** If the review reveals a fundamental flaw (e.g., the design does not meet a key requirement), the agent will **return to the appropriate earlier step** in this plan to correct the error and regenerate the subsequent sections.

7.  **Finalize and Publish for Handoff.**
    *   **State:** The specification has been fully drafted and internally validated.
    *   **Intent:** The intent is to finalize the document, save it to the designated project repository, and formally **announce its completion**. This action marks the official end of the planning phase and signals that the project is ready for implementation.
    *   **Success Condition:** The final specification document is successfully saved to the target location, and a notification is sent to the relevant stakeholders.
    *   **Fallback Intent:** If the agent is unable to save the document to the designated location due to a permissions error or other issue, it will provide the complete document content directly to the user and **report the publishing failure**.
