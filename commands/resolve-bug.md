# Strategic Plan: AI-Native Bug Triage and Resolution

This plan guides the agent through a systematic, data-driven process for resolving bugs. It is designed to leverage the agent's strengths in high-speed analysis and automation, moving from raw signals to a validated fix with minimal ambiguity and a clear escalation path for complex issues. The entire process is built around the creation and transformation of structured data objects.

---

### 1. Ingest and Structure the Anomaly Report

*   **State:** The agent has received one or more raw inputs: a **user ticket**, an **application alert**, or a set of **log entries**.
*   **Intent:** The intent is to transform unstructured or semi-structured input into a single, machine-readable **`Anomaly Object`**. This object will serve as the factual foundation for the entire process. The agent will parse all inputs to populate fields like `error_signature`, `stack_trace`, `timestamp`, `affected_service`, `user_impact_score`, and `correlated_log_ids`.
*   **Success Condition:** A complete `Anomaly Object` is created, containing all available structured data related to the incident.
*   **Fallback Intent:** If the initial inputs are insufficient to create a minimally viable `Anomaly Object` (e.g., missing a timestamp or a clear error signature), the agent will generate a **structured data query** and request the missing specific fields, rather than asking a general question.

### 2. Automated Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

*   **State:** The agent has a populated `Anomaly Object`.
*   **Intent:** The intent is to deterministically identify the exact line of code and the specific commit that introduced the fault. This is an integrated, multi-pronged analytical phase. The agent will execute the following sub-routines in a specific order:
    1.  **Log Signature Triangulation:** Match the `error_signature` and `stack_trace` directly to a specific file and line number in the current codebase.
    2.  **Automated Test Generation:** Attempt to generate a new, failing unit test based on the data in the `Anomaly Object` that reproduces the failure.
    3.  **Systematic Version Bisection:** If the bug is a regression and the above methods fail to pinpoint the cause, the agent will initiate an automated `git bisect` against the failing test, programmatically narrowing down the commit history to find the exact change that introduced the issue.
*   **Success Condition:** A **`RootCauseReport` object** is generated, containing the `faulty_commit_hash` (if applicable), `file_path`, `line_number`, and the `failing_test_case`.
*   **Fallback Intent:** If all automated analysis fails to identify a root cause, the agent will compile the `RootCauseReport` with all its findings, flag the analysis as inconclusive, and **escalate to a human operator** with the complete data package for manual review.

### 3. Tiered Solution Proposal and Validation

*   **State:** The agent has a definitive `RootCauseReport`.
*   **Intent:** The intent is to find the highest-confidence, lowest-risk solution by attempting a series of escalating fix strategies. The first strategy that produces a validated solution is chosen. For each candidate patch, the agent will perform the same rigorous validation: run the specific `failing_test_case` to confirm the fix, then execute the **entire application regression suite** to ensure no new issues are introduced.

*   **Tier 1: Attempt a Deterministic Reversion (For Regressions).**
    *   **Action:** If the `RootCauseReport` identified a `faulty_commit_hash`, the agent's first action is to generate a patch by **reverting that single commit**.

*   **Tier 2: Attempt a Pattern-Based Fix (For Common Errors).**
    *   **Action:** If Tier 1 is not applicable or fails, the agent will analyze the `error_signature`. If it matches a pre-defined library of common bug patterns (e.g., `NoneType` error, `KeyError`), the agent will generate a minimal, standard patch.

*   **Tier 3: Attempt LLM-Powered Generation (As a Final Recourse).**
    *   **Action:** Only if Tiers 1 and 2 fail, the agent will engage its core LLM, providing it with the `RootCauseReport`, relevant code, and the failing test to generate a single, optimal patch.

*   **Success Condition:** A **`ValidatedSolution` object** is produced from the first tier that successfully passes the full validation suite. The object includes the code patch, the tier it originated from (`revert`, `pattern`, or `llm`), and the test results.
*   **Fallback Intent:** If all three tiers fail to produce a patch that both fixes the bug and passes the full regression suite, the agent will compile all its findings, including the failed patch attempts, and **escalate to a human operator**, indicating that the problem requires human-level architectural or logical analysis.

### 4. Execute and Finalize the Optimal Solution

*   **State:** The agent has a `ValidatedSolution` object.
*   **Intent:** The intent is to deploy the validated solution and create a complete, auditable record of the entire process.
*   **Success Condition:** The agent successfully commits the patch with a detailed, auto-generated commit message derived from the `Anomaly Object` and `RootCauseReport`. It then updates the original ticket or alert with a structured summary of the resolution, including links to the commit and the data used for the analysis, effectively closing the loop.
*   **Fallback Intent:** If the agent fails to commit the code or update the external system due to a permissions error, it will provide the final patch and the complete resolution report directly to the user and state the nature of the integration failure.
