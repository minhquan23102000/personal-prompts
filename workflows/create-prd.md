### Workflow: Gathering and Documenting User Requirements

1.  **Define** the project's goals and objectives. Before gathering any requirements, it is crucial to understand what the project aims to achieve. This sets a clear direction and helps align the requirements with the project's ultimate goals.

2.  **Identify** all key stakeholders and user personas. This includes anyone who has a stake in the project's development, such as end-users, project sponsors, and technical teams, to ensure all perspectives are considered.

3.  **Elicit** requirements from stakeholders. Use a combination of techniques to gather detailed information. This can include interviews, surveys, focus groups, workshops, and analyzing existing documentation.

4.  **Document** every gathered requirement in a clear and structured format. This ensures a common understanding among all stakeholders and serves as a reference throughout the project. Use case scenarios, written from a user's perspective, can be particularly helpful.

5.  **Analyze** and prioritize the documented requirements. Not all requirements are of equal importance. A framework like MoSCoW (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have) can help determine which are essential for the initial launch.

6.  **Validate** the requirements with stakeholders. This step ensures that the documented requirements accurately reflect their needs and align with the project's objectives.

7.  **Draft** the Product Requirements Document (PRD). This document should outline the product's purpose, features, and functionality. Key elements to include are:
    *   **Objective/Goal:** Explain the "why" behind building the product.
    *   **Features:** Describe each feature, its goal, and its use case.
    *   **User Flow & Design Notes:** Provide general guidance for the user experience.
    *   **System & Environment Requirements:** Specify supported browsers, operating systems, etc.
    *   **Assumptions, Constraints, and Dependencies:** List any known conditions or limitations.

8.  **Review** the PRD with all stakeholders. Circulate the document among business and technical teams to confirm alignment on the objectives and the features included to meet them. It's a best practice to use a centralized solution for managing these reviews.

9.  **Obtain** formal sign-off on the PRD. This approval signifies that all stakeholders agree on the defined requirements and the project's scope.

10. **Store** the final PRD in the designated `prd/` folder. This document will now serve as the official guide for the development and testing teams.
