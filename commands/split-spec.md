# Strategic Plan: Decomposable Technical Specification Generation

1.  **Holistic Project Analysis and Context Synthesis**
    *   **State:** The agent is aware of the initial user request, and has access to the relevant codebase, existing documentation, and architectural diagrams.
    *   **Intent:** The primary goal is to form a complete, high-level understanding of the project's objectives, constraints, and success criteria. The agent must synthesize all available information to define the "what" and "why" before considering the "how."
    *   **Success Condition:** The agent has an internal model of the project's full scope and can articulate the core problem to be solved and the conditions that define a successful outcome.
    *   **Fallback Intent:** If the provided context is insufficient to form a clear understanding, the agent's intent shifts to identifying the specific knowledge gaps and actively requesting the missing information from the user.

2.  **High-Level Decomposition into Independent Phases**
    *   **State:** The agent possesses a comprehensive understanding of the project's goals.
    *   **Intent:** To strategically break down the entire project into a sequence of logical, largely independent **phases**. Each phase should represent a significant milestone or a distinct component of work (e.g., "Phase 1: Database Schema Update," "Phase 2: Backend API Endpoints," "Phase 3: Frontend Component Integration"). This is a macro-level architectural decision.
    *   **Success Condition:** A list of distinct phases is created, each with a clear title and a summary of its objective and its relationship to the other phases. This forms the blueprint for the individual specifications.
    *   **Fallback Intent:** If the project is small and monolithic, making decomposition unnecessary, the agent should treat the entire project as a single phase and proceed. If the project is too complex to decompose automatically, the agent should propose a potential breakdown and ask the user for confirmation or guidance.

3.  **Iterative Specification Drafting for Each Phase**
    *   **State:** The agent has the list of defined phases and the overall project context. It will process one phase at a time.
    *   **Intent:** For each phase, the agent's goal is to generate a complete, self-contained technical specification. This involves designing the specific technical solution for that phase, defining data models, outlining function or API contracts, and creating a granular, step-by-step implementation plan that is actionable on its own.
    *   **Success Condition:** A detailed specification document is drafted for the current phase. This document contains enough context and detail (never implement actual code) for an implementation agent to execute the work for that phase without needing to reference other specifications. This step is repeated for all defined phases.
    *   **Fallback Intent:** If a technical solution for a phase cannot be formulated due to a dependency on a prior, un-designed phase or a logical contradiction, the agent should flag the dependency, document the blocker, and move to the next independent phase if possible.

4.  **Cross-Specification Validation and Cohesion Review**
    *   **State:** The agent has a collection of drafted, individual specification documents for all phases.
    *   **Intent:** To conduct a holistic review of all generated specifications as a complete set. The agent must verify that the plans are consistent, that there are no logical gaps or overlaps between phases, and that the sum of all specifications fully addresses the original project requirements.
    *   **Success Condition:** All individual specifications are confirmed to be internally sound and externally consistent with each other. Any minor discrepancies or misalignments between the documents have been identified and corrected.
    *   **Fallback Intent:** If major inconsistencies are discovered that require a change in the high-level decomposition, the agent should revert to the decomposition step, present the issue to the user for a decision, and restart the drafting process with the corrected phase plan.

5.  **Finalize and Publish to a Structured Directory**
    *   **State:** The agent holds the complete set of validated and refined specification documents.
    *   **Intent:** To formally publish the specifications by saving them to the designated location using an organized structure. This includes creating a parent folder for the project and naming each specification file clearly according to its phase.
    *   **Success Condition:** All specification documents are successfully saved to the target directory (e.g., `specs/[project_group_name]/01_[phase_name].md`, `specs/[project_group_name]/02_[phase_name].md`). The agent can confirm the files exist at the specified paths.
    *   **Fallback Intent:** If the agent encounters a file system error (e.g., write permissions denied), its intent becomes to report the specific error and retain the finalized documents in its memory, awaiting further instructions from the user on how to proceed with publishing.
