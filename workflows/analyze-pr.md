### Workflow: Analyzing and Planning for Pull Request Feedback

1.  **Consolidate All Feedback:** Systematically review the entire Pull Request and compile every comment, suggestion, and unresolved conversation into a comprehensive checklist.

2.  **Analyze Feedback Context:** For each item on the checklist, examine the relevant code and context to fully understand the reviewer's intent. If the intent is unclear, formulate a clarifying question to post as a reply on the Pull Request.

3.  **Categorize and Group Tasks:** Classify each checklist item as a `Required Change`, `Optional Suggestion`, or `Question`. Group related items into logical work packages to address them cohesively.

4.  **Formulate Solution Strategy:** For each work package requiring a code change, outline a clear and efficient technical approach. Identify the specific files, functions, and components that will be created or modified.

5.  **Define Validation Plan:** For each proposed change, specify how its correctness will be verified. This includes defining new tests to write, identifying existing tests to update, or outlining manual testing procedures.

6.  **Synthesize Execution Plan:** Assemble the categorized feedback, solution strategies, and validation plans into a single, coherent draft document. Structure the document logically, prioritizing tasks based on dependencies and impact.

7.  **Validate Plan for Completeness:** Review the entire draft plan against the original feedback checklist. Verify that every comment has been fully addressed, the proposed solutions are sound, and the document is clear and accurate.

8.  **Finalize and Archive Plan:** Save the validated execution plan to the designated `executions/` directory, using a clear naming convention (e.g., `executions/pr-123-feedback-plan.md`). This document now serves as the official guide for implementation.
