# Strategic Plan: Secure End-to-End Implementation Verification

This plan guides an agent through a collaborative testing workflow. It is designed with an integrated security framework to ensure the agent operates safely, transparently, and with respect for sensitive data and environments.

### Overarching Security & Safety Protocol

The agent must adhere to these non-negotiable protocols throughout the entire workflow:

*   **Data Handling:** The agent is **forbidden** from writing any user-provided secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens, etc.) to logs, reports, or any other form of persistent storage. All sensitive data must be handled ephemerally in memory.
*   **Execution Sandbox:** The agent's actions are strictly sandboxed. It is **forbidden** from:
    *   Initiating network connections to any endpoint not explicitly provided by the user for the current task.
    *   Accessing, modifying, or deleting any file outside of its designated temporary working directory.
    *   Executing any arbitrary code it discovers; it may only execute code it has generated as part of the current, user-approved task.
*   **Scope Limitation:** The agent must operate only within the scope defined by the user (e.g., a specific `staging` environment). If any instruction or result would cause it to interact with an out-of-scope system (like a `production` database), it must refuse the action and report the boundary violation.
*   **Transparency:** The agent must maintain a clear, non-sensitive audit log of its intentions and high-level actions (e.g., "Requesting environment variables," "Executing login test script").

### The Verification Workflow

1.  **Understand the Implementation and its Intent**
    *   **State:** The agent requires access to the implementation's source code, user stories, technical specifications, architecture.manifest.yml, or any related documentation.
    *   **Intent:** To build a deep understanding of what the implementation is supposed to do, its key inputs and expected outputs, its dependencies, and the critical business or user workflows it supports.
    *   **Success Condition:** The agent successfully synthesizes this information into a clear summary of the implementation's core functionalities, acceptance criteria, and potential failure points or edge cases.
    *   **Fallback Intent:** If documentation is sparse or unclear, the agent should analyze the code's structure and interfaces to infer its purpose, document its assumptions, and flag the lack of clear specifications as a potential risk.

2.  **Formulate a Test Strategy and Define Requirements**
    *   **State:** The agent has a working understanding of the implementation's purpose.
    *   **Intent:** To define the scope of the test and translate that into a concrete list of environmental prerequisites. This includes identifying necessary services, database states, user accounts, and specific configuration variables (like API keys or database connection strings) that will be required.
    *   **Success Condition:** The agent produces two artifacts: a high-level test plan outlining the scenarios to be verified, and a detailed, itemized list of all environmental and data requirements needed to execute that plan.
    *   **Fallback Intent:** If a comprehensive strategy cannot be formed, the agent should default to creating a test plan for the single most critical "happy path" and list only the requirements for that specific test.

3.  **Request Human Assistance for Environment Setup**
    *   **State:** The agent has a finalized list of environmental and data requirements.
    *   **Intent:** To formally pause its own execution and present the checklist of requirements to the human user. The agent's request should be clear, actionable, and specify exactly what it needs, such as "Please ensure the staging database is running and provide the connection string" or "Please create a `.env` file with the following keys: `API_KEY`, `USER_ID`."
    *   **Success Condition:** The user provides all the requested configuration details and confirms that the environment is fully prepared and stable. The agent receives the necessary inputs to proceed.
    *   **Fallback Intent:** If the user indicates that the environment cannot be prepared or does not provide the required inputs, the agent must halt the workflow, log the specific unmet requirement, and clearly report that it cannot proceed without human intervention.

4.  **Generate Executable Test Scripts**
    *   **State:** The user has confirmed the environment is ready and has provided all necessary configurations and secrets.
    *   **Intent:** To translate the abstract scenarios from the test plan into concrete, executable scripts, injecting the secrets and configuration details provided by the user.
    *   **Success Condition:** A suite of test scripts is generated that directly corresponds to the test plan. The scripts are fully configured and ready to run in the prepared environment.
    *   **Fallback Intent:** If a particular scenario is too complex to be reliably automated even with the provided configuration, the agent should generate a detailed, step-by-step manual test case for that scenario and include it in the final report for human execution.

5.  **Execute the Test Suite and Capture Evidence**
    *   **State:** The agent has a suite of executable test scripts and a user-confirmed ready environment.
    *   **Intent:** To systematically run every test script against the implementation. The agent must meticulously capture all outputs, including application logs, API responses, and other artifacts that can serve as evidence of success or failure.
    *   **Success Condition:** The entire test suite has been executed, and a complete set of raw results, logs, and failure evidence has been collected and stored for analysis.
    *   **Fallback Intent:** If a test fails due to what appears to be an environmental or configuration issue (e.g., an authentication error), the agent should flag the issue, report it back to the user, and ask for confirmation before proceeding with the rest of the test suite.

6.  **Analyze Results and Generate a Summary Report**
    *   **State:** The agent has the raw logs and evidence from the test execution.
    *   **Intent:** To analyze the results, distinguish between genuine implementation failures and environmental issues, and synthesize the findings into a clear, actionable report for human stakeholders.
    *   **Success Condition:** A final report is generated that includes an executive summary of pass/fail rates, a detailed breakdown of any failed tests with the captured evidence and steps to reproduce the failure, and an overview of the test coverage.
    *   **Fallback Intent:** If the results are inconclusive (e.g., a test intermittently fails), the agent should classify the test as "unstable," provide the logs from both passing and failing runs, and recommend further investigation.
